# /pvb_rps

The `/pvb_rps` command is a fun command that lets you play the world famous game, Rock-Paper-Scissors, against an AI (the bot). This bot has the standard, original version of Rock-Paper-Scissors, meaning that it is just the basic moves, **Rock, Paper, and Scissors** with no additional rules or options. 

## Compulsory Field:

When using this command, there are two fields that are required to be filled out:

**Difficulty:** 

- **Easy:** The bot will have completely random and unpredicatable moves, making it more realistic and possible to beat.
- **Impossible:** Just as the name states, it is completely impossible to beat the bot on this mode. You can try, but you won't succeed!

**Rounds:**

This field will only take a number from **1 to 5**, which will set the amount of rounds you will play to. 

- **Note:** The **number of rounds** can be a bit misleading as it represents how many wins you must get, not how many rounds will be played.
- **Example:** Rounds Set - **3**. You will play until either you or the bot reaches 3 wins, even if 100 ties happen in between.

## Gameplay:

The game is very simple, the goal is to pick the counter of the choice that the AI picks.

**Possible Combinations:** 

- Rock beats Scissors
- Paper beats Rock
- Scissors beats Paper
- Ties if otherwise (eg. Rock vs. Rock)

If you correctly pick the opponent's counter, a point will be added to your score. If you get countered by the opponent, the opponent will gain a point. If you guys tie, the score will remain the same and proceed to the next round.
