# /pvb_rps

The `/pvb_rps` command is a fun command that lets you play the world famous game, Rock-Paper-Scissors, against an AI (the bot). This bot has the standard, original version of Tic-Tac-Toe, meaning that it is played on a 3x3 board with no additional rules other than claiming a square and trying to get three in a row first. The player will always have the first move.

## Compulsory Field:

When using this command, there are four different gamemodes which you can play:

- **Easy:** The bot will have completely randomized moves, making it completely unpredicatable.
- **Medium:** The bot will be random for the most part, but is able to notice when you are one move from winning.
- **Hard:** The bot will play with perfect theory, making the best move possible every single time.
- **Random:** The bot will choose randomly whether it wants to be **Easy, Medium, or Hard.**

## Gameplay:

The game is very simple, the goal is to get 3 in a row before the opponent (horizontally, vertically, or diaganolly).

- When you use the command, the game will automatically pop up for you. There will be a 3x3 board made of buttons.
- To claim the spot you want, simply just click the button on the spot you want and it will automatically change to your square.
- If there is no winner, the text will signify that it is a tie and the game will clarify that.
- Otherwise, if there is a winner, it will mention whether it was the player or AI and highlight the winning line green.
