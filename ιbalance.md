# /balance

The `/balance` command is a simple command that let's you check:
- Your Withdrawn Money (Balance)
- Your Deposited Money (Bank Balance)
- Your Total Balance (Balance + Bank Balance)

## Compulsory Field:

There is an optional compulsory field called `user` that you can enter. This field let's you:
- Put in a **Discord User ID** or a **Discord Username**
- Check the chosen user's balance

If this field is left empty, it will default to the command invoker (you), so you don't have to fill out this field if you just want to check your own balance.
