# PvB Commands

Are you ever bored and have nothing to do? Well, we provide a cure for that with our PvB Commands! These are some fun commands you can play against the bot at no cost, just for fun! Below are the list of games that we have.

- [/pvb tictactoe](https://github.com/ketarre/information/blob/main/%CE%B9%CE%B9%CE%B9%CE%B9pvb_tictactoe.md) (Play Tic Tac Toe against the bot)
- /pvb rps (Play Rock Paper Scissors against the bot)

##### Secret Perk: Every time you play one of these fun games, there is a random chance that you can earn a small bit of cash from them! Do note however it is decently rare, so it isn't entirely a money making source.
